# Toggle-Display-Adapter-Script

# *The .ps1 file has to be run as admin

It just toggles your display adapters off and then back on. I used this because when I would disconnect my laptop from an external dispaly, the brightness would be stuck super low. Doing this would fix it. Figured I'd share it.
